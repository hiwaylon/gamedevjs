# JavaScript/HTML5 game development environment using PhaserJS.
Goodies for Javascript game development using Phaser framework.

## Important Branches
- **master**: releasable, although nothing is really released from this project *(yet)*.
- **phaser-dev**: Ongoing, bleeding edge, general development. *(May not work.)*

## TODO
- **Serving:** auto server phaser-examples directory *(sorta done)*
- ~~cannonical site directory layout? Where to put index.html and js/sandbox.js?~~
- **Project management:** install taglia for self contained dev environment
- **Provisioning:** requirejs, perlin, phaser, etc : should provisioner fetch or should the be templated to lock version (staleness!), or should the provisioner fetch a version/tag?
